# MATLAB Code from University Projects
These folders contain the MATLAB code and the final report which the code was written for. 

**1. Analog Signal Conditioning Circuit:** The script helped iterate and find the optimal component selection for an analog signal conditioning circuit.  
**2. Diesel Engine P-V Analysis::** The script was used to analyse data from a diesel engine, including Pressure-Volume data to characterise its performance.  
**3. Flow Losses Practical:** The script analysed experimental data for flow losses in pipes and compares it to theoretical predictions.  
**4. Spring Pendulum Simulation:** The spring pendulum script was part of an assignment that involved developing the equations of motion then writing a script to simulate it.
