# Differential Screw 1.0
[differential_screw_image](3D printed differential screw.jpg)
A differential screw designed to be 3D printed to demonstrate the concept.

It uses two screws with different thread pitches to create a small amount of movement in the runner that can be finely controlled (assuming it's manufactured well, i.e. not FDM printed).
The two screws are M12x1.75 and M10x1.5, meaning that for every revolution of the screw the runner progresses 1.75 - 1.5 = 0.25 mm.
The concept is that the whole screw progresses forward by 1.75 mm for every revolution, while the runner moves backwards on the screw by 1.5 mm. This difference is what creates the small movement.
